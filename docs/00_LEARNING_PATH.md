# WebStore Monitoring Example - Learning Path

**Welcome!** This guide will help you learn modern observability practices through a hands-on e-commerce application.

## Overview

This project demonstrates production-ready observability across a polyglot microservices architecture using:
- **OpenTelemetry** for instrumentation (Python, Go, C#, Node.js, React)
- **OTLP** (OpenTelemetry Protocol) for transmitting telemetry data
- **Grafana Stack** for visualization (Grafana, Tempo, Loki, Prometheus)
- **Real-world patterns** including distributed tracing, metrics, logs, alerts, and SLOs
