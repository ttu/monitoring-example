  # Note: Application services (main-service, payments-service, promotions-service)
  # push metrics via OTLP to the OTEL Collector (port 4317)
  # The OTEL Collector then exports to Prometheus (port 8889)
  # External systems (payment-provider, crm-system, inventory-system) don't expose
  # metrics as they simulate third-party services
